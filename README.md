Nive-Resume
=========================

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student applying for internships, made with slight modifications from the one originally developed by Debarghya Das.

## PLEASE NOTE
The experience and awards section is just for reference while coding and is not my work. Need to overwrite that !

## Known Issues:
1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
3. Hacky redefinition of \refname to omit 'References' text for publications in the MacFonts version.
